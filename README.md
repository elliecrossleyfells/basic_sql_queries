# basic_sql_queries
A MySQL project that queries data from an astronomy DB consisting of three tables. 

Score recieved on this coursework: 100%.

Tasks undertaken:
### Manipulating data using DML commands 
- Retrieve table ordered by planet_size rather than planet_id
- Change the data in the planet_type column from lowercase to uppercase.
- Delete the first entry in all tables, because this entry is a star and not a planet and so shouldn't be in the table.
- Altering column names

### Retrieving data and using aggregate functions
- Finding the average number of moons a planet has and total number of moons in the solar system.
- Using an aggregate function to find out the average number of moons grouped by planet size.
- Finding out the date of the oldest space mission.
- Finding how many planets have no moons

### Joins
- left and right joins
- Join tables and display only select columns

### Stored function
- Creating a stored function that takes the moon_orbital_period_days and converts it hours.
